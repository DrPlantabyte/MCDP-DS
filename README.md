# MCDP-DS
Disaster Series: a Minecraft Datapack that adds scripted disasters to the game
## Scripted Events
Each event happens *once* per player (even if the trigger happens multiple times), centered on the player who triggered the event. Many events have a hidden count-down timer so that it the event happens some time after the trigger. This way, it isn't obvious what the triggering event was.
